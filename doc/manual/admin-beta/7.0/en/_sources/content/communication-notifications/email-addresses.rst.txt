Email Addresses
===============

To enable OTRS to send emails, you need a valid email address to be used by the system. OTRS is capable of working with multiple email addresses, since many support installations need to use more than one. A queue can be linked to many email addresses, and vice versa. The address used for outgoing messages from a queue can be set when the queue is created.

Use this screen to add system email addresses to the system. An email address is already added to the system at installation time of OTRS. The email address management screen is available in the *Email Addresses* module of the *Communication & Notifications* group.
