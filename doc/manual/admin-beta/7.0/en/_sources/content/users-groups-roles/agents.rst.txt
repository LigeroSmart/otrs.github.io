Agents
======

Use this screen to add agents to the system. A fresh OTRS installation contains an agent with administrator privileges by default. The agent management screen is available in the *Agents* module of the *Users, Groups & Roles* group.

It is also possible to edit the agent personal preferences. To do this, click on the *Edit personal preferences for this agent* button in the left sidebar of the *Edit Agent* screen.

To find an agent:

1. Enter a search term to the search box in the left sidebar.
2. Click on the magnifying glass icon in the right part of the field or hit an ``Enter``. 

.. note::

   If several agents are added to the system, use the search box to find a particular agent. Only the first 1000 agents are listed by default.

The agent permissions can be controlled by adding an agent to :doc:`groups` or :doc:`roles`. This can result a complex matrix of permissions. The effective permissions for an agent can be checked in the bottom of the *Edit Agent* screen.
